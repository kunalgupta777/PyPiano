# PyPiano
Piano Simulation in Pygame
Currently PyPiano is in development.
I aim to include all the keys of piano in it.
Also, pygame's sound channel capabilities have not been fully exploited , so contrubutions in that area are required as well.

## Dependencies:
1. Python 2.7x 
2. Pygame 1.9.3 onwards
